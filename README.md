Project Title: Sudoku Solver
Project Description:
The Sudoku Solver is a web application that allows users to input Sudoku puzzles and solve them automatically using a backtracking algorithm. It provides an interactive interface for users to input puzzles and visualize the solving process step by step. Users can also reset the grid, generate random Sudoku puzzles, and validate their own solutions. The app is built using modern web development technologies, ensuring a smooth and responsive user experience.

Technologies Used:
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React.js for building components and managing state)
Backend (optional): Node.js (if server-side Sudoku generation/validation is needed)
Styling: CSS (or styled-components if using React)
Algorithms: Backtracking algorithm for solving the puzzle
Features:
Interactive Sudoku Grid:

A 9x9 grid where users can input numbers.
Input validation to ensure numbers range between 1 and 9.
Users can fill the grid manually or generate a random puzzle.
Sudoku Solver:

A button to solve the puzzle using the backtracking algorithm.
Real-time visualization of the solving process, highlighting cells as the algorithm progresses.
A timer to show how long it takes to solve the puzzle.
Puzzle Validator:

Users can check if their manually input puzzle is solvable.
Error messages if the puzzle violates Sudoku rules (e.g., duplicate numbers in rows, columns, or subgrids).
Puzzle Generator:

Option to generate a new random Sudoku puzzle with different difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard).
Reset and Clear Options:

A button to clear the entire grid.
An option to reset the puzzle to its initial state if a generated puzzle was modified.
